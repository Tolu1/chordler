### What does Chordler do?

`Raw Dataset` ⟶ `Chordler v1.0` ⟶ `Annotated Dataset`

Annotating music datasets can be immensely tedious, **Chordler** helps to provide a clean way to monitor and manage annotations of music files. Experts/Users can make annotations for a music dataset easily in the GUI application. 

For now **Chordler** will ship with a single feature and will grow subsequently to many others, the initial feature will deliver the capability of annotating music files at frame level with their appropriate musical chords and monitoring playback simultaneously.
